# Password Generator

## Overview

In this challenge, I created a fully functional password generator where, after choosing from a few prompts, it will generate a password that fits the requirements you have chosen.

## Additions

I cloned the starting html and css files in order to create the foundation, however I did not use any of the javascript code and instead chose to write it myself from scratch.
